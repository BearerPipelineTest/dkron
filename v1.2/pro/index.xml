      <description>Getting started Dkron Pro provides a clustering backend store out of the box based on etcd.
To configure the storage a sample etcd.conf.yaml file is provided in /etc/dkron path. Editing the file, allows to configure several options for the embedded store.
The location of the store configuration can be set in the command line or in the dkron config file /etc/dkron/dkron.yml using etcd-config-file-path parameter.
Starting a single node Works out of the box, good for non HA installations.</description>

      <description>Dkron Pro has the ability to be configured to use HTTP basic auth.
Authentication can be set using these parameters in the dkron config file:
# dkron.yml username: dkron_admin password: adminpassword This will enable auth on the WebUI and for the API.</description>

      <description>Configure a cluster First follow the Dkron clustering guide then you can continue with this guide.
The embedded store also needs to know its peers, it needs its own configuration as in the following example:
# etcd.conf.yaml # Initial cluster configuration for bootstrapping. initial-cluster: dkron1=https://10.19.3.9:2380,dkron2=https://10.19.4.64:2380,dkron3=https://10.19.7.215:2380 With this configuration Dkron Pro should start in cluster mode with embedded storage.
For a more in detail guide of clustering with etcd follow this guide: https://github.</description>

      <description>Dkron Pro has an embedded distributed KV store engine based on etcd. This works out of the box on each node dkron server is started.
This ensures a dead easy install and setup, basically run dkron and you will have a full working node and at the same time provides you with a fully tested well supported store for its use with dkron.</description>

      <guid>/v1.2/pro/encryption/</guid>
      <description>SSL encryption is used for communicating dkron pro and the embedded store, and between storage nodes itself. Also if client auth is enabled, only dkron pro clients can talk to the embedded store. This means that no other software running on your local network will be able to talk to dkron&amp;rsquo;s etcd server.
This ensures that no unexpected usage of the Dkron&amp;rsquo;s store will happen, unless it is another Dkron pro instance.</description>
